# Dota 2 Immortal Economy

Made in React/Vite with Typescript as a way to modernize the Steam Community Market with bulk searching for prices. 

Steam's market interface crashes on me almost every time I click a button so, after a couple hundred refreshes while trying to search for cheap Immortals, instead I created an API in Python to fetch the relevant data I want to see and cache it in a React web app to have a list of static data and link it to the Steam Market when I find something to either buy or sell. Currently only supports Immortal rarity and Arcana rarity.
